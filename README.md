# cats_dogs_localization

Scripts for training and testing convolutional neural network for localization of the object.

This script builds models using these libraries "https://github.com/qubvel/classification_models" and 
"https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet". Using these libraries made it possible to quickly test various models and 
choose the best option for solving the localization problem.

You can view or set parameters in config.py

To train the model, a dataset consisting of 1037 images of cats and 2348 images of dogs was used, 3385 in total. 
This dataset consists of the "Oxford IIIT Pet Dataset".

## 1. Dataset preparation
My dataset has this configuration:
```
cats_dogs_dataset/
             train/
                Abyssinian_1.jpg
                Abyssinian_1.txt
                ...
             valid/
                Abyssinian_116.jpg
                Abyssinian_116.txt
                ...
``` 

## 2. Training
Run training script with default parameters:
```shell script
python train.py --train
```
If you want to make a training with a different input resolution, then you can use 
```shell script
python train.py --train_dif_shape
```
## 3. Plotting graphs
If you want to build graphs from saved logs, you can use tens or board by passing the path to the logs folder.
```shell script
tensorboard --logdir models_data/tensorboard_logs/resnet18_imagenet_2021-05-23_15-19-49
```
## 4. Testing
If you want to use webcam for the test, you should pass two arguments --weights and --webcam. 
```shell script
python test.py --weights models_data/resnet18_2021-06-21_16-17-12_shape-256-256/save_models/resnet18.h5 --webcam
```
If you want to calculate the average value of losses and indicators on val_data, you should use --metrics and --weights.
```shell script
python test.py --metrics --weights models_data/resnet18_2021-06-21_16-17-12_shape-256-256/save_models/resnet18.h5
```
If you want to calculate the average inference time and average fps and indicators on val_data, you should use --time 
and --weights.
```shell script
python test.py --time --weights models_data/resnet18_2021-06-21_16-17-12_shape-256-256/save_models/resnet18.h5
```
If you want to use gpu for test, you should use --gpu with number gpu. If you don't want to use the gpu then you don't 
need to specify this parameter.
```shell script
python test.py --gpu 0 test.py --webcam --weights models_data/resnet18_2021-06-21_16-17-12_shape-256-256/save_models/resnet18.h5
```
## 5. Docker 
You can also use Docker. To build an image, you can go to the docker folder and run the following command
```shell script
docker build -t name_image .
```
To run the container, you can use the following command
```shell script
docker run -itd --rm --name cats_dogs_detec -v $(pwd)/file_share:/detection/file_share name_image
```
To use the console in the container, you need to
```shell script
docker exec -it cats_dogs_detec bash
```
After that, you can move the files you want to use for the test to the file_share folder. Then run the script using the 
following command
To use the console in the container, you need to
```shell script
python file_processing.py --input file_share/folder_with_test_images
```
As a result, you will get the processed files.
## Results
The table displays the resulting metrics and other information on a validation dataset consisting of 799 images. All 
models used weights "imagenet" and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate 0.0001. These results are averaged.
